# Word Game Readme

### About

This is a word game, similiar to hangman, but less morbid.
Users can create their own list of words to be used in the game, and use CRUD actions to update this list as they choose.
Alternately, I've integrated with a third-party API, [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/), so that users can also play the game with a random word from their database.

I created a schedule for myself with stages for this project, as I know I'm inclined towards "feature creep." First, I created the back end. When this was complete, I made a front end that was able to do all of the CRUD actions. Once this was done, I made the game functionality. The game is built with Javascript and jQuery to update the page that the user sees.

I skipped phase 2 (scorekeeping) and went straight to phase 3 (integrating a third-party API,) as I was keen to get the random words integrated into the game.

In the future, I would like to add another table for wins and scorekeeping. I'd also like to add graphics rather than simply the 'timer' counting down turns.
